```json
{
  "headline": "Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariffs if it makes a deal with China"
}
```

#### Response Example

```json
{
  "prediction": "Medium Sensational",
  "cluster_id": 1,
  "headline_analysis": {
    "seo_friendly": true,
    "google_search_friendly": true,

## 🌐 API Integration (React Native Example)

```js
const analyzeHeadline = async (headline) => {
  const response = await fetch('http://YOUR_IP:8000/predict', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ headline }),
  });

  return await response.json();
};
```

## 🧠 How the Algorithm Works (Brief)

* Headlines are converted into numerical features
* Features are scaled using StandardScaler
* K-Means groups headlines into 3 natural clusters
* Each cluster is mapped to a meaningful label
* Feature contribution explains prediction logic

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

* News portals
* Blogging platforms
* SEO tools
* Content quality analysis
* Headline A/B testing
* AI-powered CMS automation

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Transformer-based emotion detection
* Multilingual headline support
* Trend-based click prediction
* Online learning for adaptive clustering
